# Testing:
Use for testing:

```
npm start ~/Documents/Repositories/files-importer/test-app/source ~/Documents/Repositories/files-importer/test-app/target
```
- [x] Manual tested `check.ts`
- [ ] Manual test `work.ts`
- [ ] Write test for `index.ts`

# Bugs:
- [ ] If relative paths are passed for source and target arguments folder are created by user (convert always to absolute pathsFor testing use)

# Improvements:
- [ ] Error `path is invalid could show up if was source or target`
- [ ] Spice up  `printErrors`, `printSuccess`, `printMessages`
